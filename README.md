### I am no longer working on this app  
  
1. API cost is too expensive for users to freely browse through.  
2. Chose to open up a direct link to the recipe to help authors' of the recipes rather than rendering on my site. But many links proivded by the api are not up to date.


# THE FOOD APP

## Problems people have!! (At least I have)

One day I feel like Gordon Ramsay and want to make Spaghetti for dinner. I go to grocery store and grab all the ingredients that will help my THING look like Spaghetti. I came back home with:</br>

1. noodles
2. tomato sauces
3. garlics
4. bunch of meatballs
5. basil
6. mushrooms
7. 8, 9 10 other stuffs...
   </br>
   </br>
   Somehow, Spaghetti looking thing came out and my dinner was taken care of. Even after I dumped half of what I bought, I still have a lot of leftover that are ready to be shoved into the shelves and waiting for the end date of my apartment lease.
   </br>
   </br>

## Solution?

# Techs used for this project

### Frontend

- React
- Styled components
- React router dom
- **_Redux toolkit / Redux thunk_**
  </br>

### Backend

- Nodejs
- Express
- Winston
  </br>
  </br>

**I haven't looked into Redux after react came up with its own context api. But when I visited its documentation and read about the slice from toolkit, I thought this could bring a different aspect of code base from regular redux/react pattern**
